# Public Transportation for Disabled People: "Hand", a possible Improvement

The idea behind this project was to develop step by step "Hand", a digital innovation related to public transportation for disabled people. After having chosen the scenario and individuated something to improve within it, we started from the analysis of the context, passed to the selection of our targets, and finally to the idea generation and evaluation. We then focused on our future customers designing their journey (i.e., customer journey), their goals (i.e., goal posters), and the various models describing their experience on our future platform (i.e., BPMN, UI/UX). At this point, we started to work on the technical side of the project designing the whole information system and enterprise architecture to support the application. Finally, we developed a small prototype taking care of the previous constraints.

The whitepaper.pdf describes the whole process we followed. Moreover, it is possible to find inside the "prototype" folder the small piece of code we developed.
